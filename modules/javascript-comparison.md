# JavaScript Comparison

## Requirements

Compare some numbers then determine which one is bigger or smaller.

Input:

- Two or more different numbers

Process:

- Compare number and number

Output:

- Telling which one is bigger or smaller

## Using Conditionals

- Store different numbers into some variables
- Create some `if else` statement blocks that tell if each number is bigger or smaller than our determined value
- Log that results to the console

## Using Multiple Conditionals

- Try to compare those numbers with each other
- Expand the `if else` statements into multiple chains

```js
if (condition) {
  // code
} else if (condition) {
  // code
} else {
  // code
}
```

## Using Ternary Operator

- Use ternary operator `? :` rather than `if else` statement

```js
condition ? resultA : resultB
```

## Using Range and Logical Operators

- Try to compare a variable with value range, with more than 2 conditions, bigger and smaller than some different value at the same time
- Experiment with various kind of operations

```js
min >= condition >= max
```

```js
conditionA && conditionB
```

## Using Functions

- Wrap those logics into some functions that can be called later
- Use parameters to enable us assign different kind of inputs to compare
- You need at least two parameters for these functions

```js
function process(parameterA, parameterB) {
  // code
}

process()
```

## Using Random Function

- Create a random number generator
