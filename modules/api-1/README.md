## HTTP

HTTP is a protocol which allows the fetching of resources, such as HTML documents. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser.

### HTTP Communication Process

### HTTP Request Structure

- Request line: First line of HTTP Request, consist of HTTP Verb, URI, and HTTP version number.
- Header: Describe specific property of a request.
- Body: Additiaonal information about request.

### HTTP Response Structure

- Status line: First line of HTTP Response, consist of HTTP version, status code, and reason parse.
- Header : Optional response header.
- Body : Requested resource

### HTTP header

HTTP headers allow the client and the server to pass additional information with the request or the response. A request header consists of its case-insensitive name followed by a colon ':', then by its value (without line breaks). You can see it through you browser by using developer tools (Network tab).

### HTTP verbs

HTTP defines a set of request methods to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resource.

**HTTP Verb & Description**

- `GET` = The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using `GET` should only retrieve data.
- `POST` = The `POST` method is used to submit an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.
- `PUT` = The `PUT` method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.
- `DELETE` = The `DELETE` method deletes the specified resource.
- `CONNECT` = The `CONNECT` method establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource.
- `OPTIONS` = The `OPTIONS` method is used to describe the communication options for the target resource.
- `HEAD` = The `HEAD` method asks for a response identical to that of a `GET` request, but without the response body.

## Restful APIs

### What is an API

Application Programming Interface (API) is a term for describing how a programs communicate and exchange data in certain format.

### What is REST

REpresentational State Transfer (REST) is a one of many architectural style of an API. A RESTful API is an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests (HTTP verbs) to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data.

### Another API Architecture

- SOAP
- GraphQL
- gRPC

## Example of RESTful API designs

| Route                       | HTTP Verb | Description                  |
| --------------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------- |
| `example.com/api/items`     | `GET`     | Get all the items            |
| `example.com/api/items/:id` | `GET`     | Get a single item            |
| `example.com/api/items`     | `POST`    | Save an item                 |
| `example.com/api/items`     | `DELETE`  | Remove all the items         |
| `example.com/api/items/:id` | `DELETE`  | Remove an item               |
| `example.com/api/items/:id` | `PUT`     | Update an item with new info |

## Example of Github RESTful API

| Route                                     | HTTP Verb | Description             |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------- | ----------------------- |
| `api.github.com/users`                    | `GET`     | Get all users (limited) |
| `api.github.com/users/username`           | `GET`     | Get a single user       |
| `api.github.com/users/username/followers` | `GET`     | Get user followers      |
| `api.github.com/users/username/following` | `GET`     | Get following users     |

## REST API Client

CLI:

- [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/)
- [HTTPie](https://httpie.org)

GUI:

- [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com)
- [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest)

## Fetching data from API

The `fetch()` browser API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as requests and responses. Keep in mind that `fetch` is natively only available on the browser, not server side.

A request to API will return as a javascript response object. We can use `.json()` built in method to returns a promise that resolves with the result of parsing the body text as JSON.

example:

```js
fetch('https://api.github.com/users/username')
  .then(response => {
    return response.json()
  })
  .then(data => {
    console.log(data)
  })
```

### Websocket

WebSockets are an advanced technology that makes it possible to open an interactive communication session between the user's browser and a server. With this API, you can send messages to a server and receive event-driven responses without having to poll the server for a reply.

# Web Services

There are various web API services we can use and connect with.

- GitHub, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Wikipedia
- Mailchimp, Google Forms
- Google Maps, OpenStreetMap
- Trello, Slack, etc

# Internet Trivia

There are various web protocols available today:

- FTP
- Telnet
- WebSocket
- Socket.io
- WebRTC

The last three are used for real-time functionality.
