# Non-Relational Database

## NoSQL

NoSQL (not only SQL) database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in other than using relational way.

Data manipulation is often done through object-oriented functions or APIs. There's no specific query language like SQL.

## NoSQL Database Types

**Document databases:** pair each key with a complex data structure known as a document. Documents can contain many different key-value pairs, or key-array pairs, or even nested documents.

**Graph stores:** are used to store information about networks of data, such as social connections. Graph stores include Neo4J and Giraph.

**Key-value stores:** are the simplest NoSQL databases. Every single item in the database is stored as an attribute name (or 'key'), together with its value. Examples of key-value stores are Riak and Berkeley DB. Some key-value stores, such as Redis, allow each value to have a type, such as 'integer', which adds functionality.

**Wide-column stores:** such as Cassandra and HBase are optimized for queries over large datasets, and store columns of data together, instead of rows.
