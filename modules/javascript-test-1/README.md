- ‚ñ¢ Testing Methodologies
  - Unit
  - Functional
  - Integration/API
  - E2E
- ‚ñ¢ Testing Tools
  - Mocha, Chai, Jasmine, Karma, Selenium, Nightmare, CucumberJS
- ‚ñ¢ Testing Techniques
  - TDD (Test Driven Development)
  - BDD (Behavior Driven Development)
  - ATDD (Automated Test Driven Development)
  - HDD (Hypothesis Driven Development)
  - Continuous Integration (CI): Jenkins, Travis
  - Continuous Deployment (CD)
