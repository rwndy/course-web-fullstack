# Paradigm 3 - FP

## Functional Programming (FP)

Some popular concepts in functional programming are:

- Pure first-class functions. Using functions that avoid accessing or mutating outer variables.
- Data immutability. There is no dynamic variables, but only constants.
- No manual loop anymore, array methods or recursion are preferred.
- Higher Order Component (HOC). A function that takes a function/component and returns a new function/component.
